## Documentation

This folder is used for the documentation website at https://openplannerteam.github.io/planner.js/

Travis-CI will automatically add a folder code/ in here with the TypeDoc documentation extracted from the codebase. Do not change the gh-pages branch manually. Instead, change the contents of docs/ in the master branch, or change the documentation in the codebase itself to change the code documentation.
